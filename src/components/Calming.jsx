<h1>BIPOLAR DISORDER</h1>
            <p>Bipolar Disorder is a type of mood disorder. However, unlike in Depression, the problem in Bipolar Disorder is in the brain’s regulation of the usual ups and downs of normal mood. In Bipolar Disorder, people cycle between periods of Mania (i.e., feeling really elevated or irritable) and periods of either normal mood or Depression (i.e., feeling really sad and low). These cycles (sometimes called episodes) of Depression and Mania may be frequent (daily) or infrequent (years apart). Although adults in a manic episode can act euphoric and grandiose, young people in a manic episode can sometimes appear more irritable and grandiose.</p>

            <h3>Psychological Treatments</h3>
            <p>Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy”, can be helpful for dealing with the associated stress of Bipolar Disorder.

        <h1>PANIC DISORDER</h1>
        <p>Panic Disorder occurs when people suffer from sudden, unexpected and uncontrollable panic attacks. These panic attacks aren’t caused by any obvious fear (e.g., having a panic attack because you’re afraid of heights and on top of a ladder or if you’re afraid of flying and about to board a plane). People with Panic Disorder also experience anticipatory anxiety (worrying about having another attack or the consequences of having another attack) and avoid going to places where a panic attack might happen.</p>

        <h3>Medication</h3>
        <p>Medications may also be used in combination with CBT. There are a number of different medications that might be prescribed, although Serotonin Specific Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly used. For more information on how to properly use medications</p>

Depression is different than feeling sad or down. It is a medical condition affecting the way mood is controlled by the brain.
